		<p> Montakan Namthong – Graphic Designer</p>
			<p>I am currently a third year student in the Graphic Designer program at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, visual designer who loves puppy, Blythe Dolls, bags and hats. I love almost everything about technology; it is intended to make our lives easier.</p>
			<p>I really like to learn and know something new, I think being Designer, though, is really a skill that is taught and learned.  It’s taken me down different paths that I would’ve never explored before. A lot of times what really excites me most about creativity is the fact that I never really know what I’m going to have to create. So it’s always that challenge of having to do something that I haven’t done before. This is a great way to develop skills, learn more about visual concepts to communicate ideas that inspire, inform, or captivate audience. And all of that enables me to see more options in front of my eyes.</p>
			<p>Over the years my work and design style has become contemporary, artistic and organic. I love to work with watercolor, textures and patterns, and creating a beautiful that is unique to each work.</p>
