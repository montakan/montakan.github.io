			 Based a selection of texts provided, a sequence of pages, comprising a short story or an essay, were designed using type and images formatted as a contemporary magazine. The project includes use of page grids, to build a series of 2-page spreads, using design methods to promote readersâ€™ understanding and appreciation.

		  I chose the article of "The Octopus That Almost Ate Seattle", by saying that most of the people who were and are upset about the killing of octopus are vegetarian and vegan, and capable of recognizing that highly intelligent creatures should not be hunted for food. Plus, a main focus of the article, the idea of locally sourced food, resonates with many people and overlaps with a variety of lifestyles, not just specifically those who object to killing animals. </p>

			 For my illustration, I was thinking about the idea of Octopus escaping through a window or frame as the Octopus try to escape from human. Octopuses just like humans have a nervous system, which allows them to feel pain. Octopuses are like human beings. They should not be killed for any reason. People need to treat them like their own self. Species of animals are declining due to hunting.  We should not hunt these wonderful creatures.
